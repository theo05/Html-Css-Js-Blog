                                <h6>A Step-By-Step Guide to Flexible Dieting</h6>
                                <h2>Body Compositiont</h2>
                                <p>Back in 2011, I first went onto bodybuilding.com and started learning about calories and macros. I am not necessarily proud of that starting point. But it was my introduction to a concept called If It Fits Your Macros (IIFYM) which basically meant that it did not really matter what you ate as long as you meet your macronutrient targets. From a body composition perspective, while it is obviously a bit more nuanced than that, the outcomes will be mostly the same. Flexible dieting is a mostly interchangeable term with IIFYM. But I prefer the terminology flexible dieting</p>

                            <p>It’s easy to get confused about which foods are healthy and which aren’t.

                                You generally want to avoid certain foods if you want to lose weight and prevent chronic illnesses.
                                
                                In this article, healthy alternatives are mentioned whenever possible.
                                
                                Here are 20 foods that are generally unhealthy — although most people can eat them in moderation on special occasions without any permanent damage to their health.</p>

                            <h2>Sports</h2>
                            <p>As somebody who has gone deep down the rabbit-hole of nutrition for cramps in sport, in a bid to help give my clients and edge over their competition, I can confirm that cramps are a complex topic. There is a lot that is not known. There is a lot that does not work. And there are also a lot of people who try to simplify it down to one thing, as if one specific strategy will solve cramps for all athletes. It is clear that cramps are multifactorial. And I would wager that in the coming decades, we will probably have better solutions than we have now. Cramps are also hard to study. </p>
